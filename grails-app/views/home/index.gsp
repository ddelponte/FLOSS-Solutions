            <h1>Why FLOSS Solutions?</h1>
            <p>We specialize in providing high quality, cost effective, 
                custom software solutions that deliver real value, on-time 
                and within budget.  The success of our business is rooted 
                in three key areas:  communication, people, and technology.</p>
        
            <h2>Communication</h2>
            <p>Without open and effective communication, any software project 
                is doomed to fail.  We strive to keep our clients informed of 
                our progress every step of the way.  The work we do is made 
                available on a weekly or bi-weekly basis so that feedback may 
                be given.  We want to make sure that we deliver what our clients 
                want, and our clients appreciate the ability to get their hands 
                on working code and provide insight early in the development 
                life cycle.  Requirements are always changing and this rapid 
                turnaround approach helps to ensure that we deliver the product 
                that is desired.</p>
        
            <h2>People</h2>
            <p>Quality developers are the cornerstone of our success.  All of 
                our developers are dedicated to their craft and participate in 
                projects, clubs, and organizations outside of work to sharpen 
                and hone their skills.  This desire to learn and create is 
                fundamental to the success of our projects.</p>
            
            <h2>Technology</h2>
            <p>We use the best software the open source world has to offer to 
                provide top notch solutions.  This utilization of open source code 
                allows us to build upon well tested, stable software that results in 
                well tested, stable solutions.  Open source also allows us to avoid 
                the licensing fees associated with so many other platforms, allowing 
                us to keep costs down and provide any necessary customization.</p>

            <p>We provide a plethora of services including website development, rich 
                internet applications, server-side development, desktop applications, 
                custom development work, consulting, and search engine optimization.
